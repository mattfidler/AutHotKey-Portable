Brian All's and Jacob Mastel originally created this.  However, I
cannot find it, so I made a source repository for AutHotKey
Portable. See http://portableapps.com/node/18658

To use this, first download the AutHotkey Basic zip file and extract
and place in the =App\Autohotkey= directory.  Then compile the scripts
in the nsis directory.
